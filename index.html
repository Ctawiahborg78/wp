      <p><strong>Cassi,</strong> I would like to apologise for not playing Fortnite with you. My actions led to your frustration and disappointment on your part. I am very sorry for hurting you. Firstly, I'm sorry for agreeing to play whilst tired and leaving you waiting for me. I apologise for not responding to your messages on time, it seemed like I was disregarding your messages, which was not my intention. Also, when you didn't reply back after I said I was eating, I mistakenly assumed you were not interested in playing anymore. I realise now how this assumption was wrong and led to further confusion and disappointment. I am sorry that my lack of communication led to this. I really value our time together and I know you wanted to spend time with me as you would be busy the rest of this week and for the rest of month maybe. In the future, I'll make sure to commnicate more clearly and promptly, so as to avoid shit like this. But Cassi, please just wait till I'm out of these shackles, I've got something for you and I just hope you can wait until I'm outside. I am sorry Cassi. Please forgive me.</p>
